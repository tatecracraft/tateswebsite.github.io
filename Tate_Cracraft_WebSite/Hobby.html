<img src="Flying Hobby.jpg" alt="Flying is dope" width="200" height="220">
<p>This image shows myself in a business jet on the job, it shares my passion for aviation. One day hopefully I will be flying in that cockpit!</p>
<img src="JJ Hobby.jpg" alt="I love jj" width="200" height="220">
<p>This image shows my passion for training brazilian jiu-jitsu. I love jiu-jitsu because it is a huge mental challenge; the best representation I can make of it is playing chess while running a marathon.</p>
<img src="Fishing Hobby.jpg" alt="I love stanky fish" width="200" height="220">
<p>Anywhere when I get the chance, either on vacation or simply in town, I will always find the time to go fish. Fishing has always been a joy to me because the adrenaline rush of catching a fish, is nothing like anything else.</p>
<img src="Guns Hobby.jpg" alt="Shooting guns is cool" width="200" height="220">
<p>This was me shooting guns during thanksgiving break at my ranch, I believe my ears are still ringing. I love skeet shooting as it is always a challenge along with the competition.</p>
