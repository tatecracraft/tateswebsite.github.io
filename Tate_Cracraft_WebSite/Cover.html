<H3>My Intended Major</H3>
<li>Bachelor of Science in Aviation
<li> 2026 Projected Graduation
<H3>Experience Summary</H3>
I began my aviation career at the nearest flight school to where I lived. I made the lifelong decision to pursue this career throughout my journey. The airport where I was receiving my training was also where I obtained more experience through aviation,Â working as a Line Service Technician. I now hold a private pilot's license and am hoping to advance in my commercial pilot occupation.
<H3>My Perceived Calling</H3>
I believe that using my profession to spread the gospel around the world is what God is asking me to do. My desire to convey what it means to have a relationship with Jesus is evident in my interests in collaboration and traveling. I also think that from above, God is giving me a new perspective on his magnificent creation.
